# 6.1 RPC API

## Introduction

When you run the snarkOS software, all nodes (provers, validators, and simple clients) automatically have a local RPC API. This API exposes blockchain data so that it is accessible via simple HTTP calls.

Here is an example of an RPC API URL, exposed on the internet by the Provable team:
```
https://api.explorer.provable.com/v1/{network}
```

On your own machine, for example when running a devnet client, you should be able to access it at the following address:
```
http://127.0.0.1:3030/{network}
```

## Useful Endpoints

Let's explore some of the endpoints that might be useful for your DApps.

You can also find the full documentation for other endpoints here:
[https://developer.aleo.org/references/apis/public_api](https://developer.aleo.org/references/apis/public_api)

There are other custom APIs created by the community that can be very useful for your programs:
- [Haruka's API](https://api.explorer.provable.com/v1/{network}) (Note: This seems to be the same URL as the Provable one provided earlier, likely an example of a community-utilized endpoint)
- Leo Wallet RPC

The following endpoint to reach the latest block height can be used to test if the API is operational:
```
https://api.explorer.provable.com/v1/testnet/block/height/latest
```

# 6.2 Create an Empty Aleo dApp

## Introduction

In this section, we will learn how to create an empty Aleo web application using NPM.

## Creating the Project

To create your first empty Aleo web application using NPM:

```bash
npm create leo-app@latest
```

1. Enter the project name.

2. Choose a framework from the following options:
   - `React`
   - `Node.js`
   - `Vanilla (JavaScript)`

3. If you choose `React` as the framework, the supported templates are:
   - `JavaScript` + `Leo`
   - `TypeScript` + `Leo`
   - `TypeScript` + `Next.js`

## Project Setup

Navigate to the project you just installed:

```bash
cd aleo-project
npm install
npm run install-leo
npm run dev
```

This installs all required modules as well as Leo, our statically typed programming language designed for writing private applications. Finally, we initialized a local instance of your React application at http://localhost:5173.

Project Structure:
- `src/App.jsx` contains the main body of your React application.
- The `helloworld` folder is your Leo program.
- `src/workers/worker.js` is the WebAssembly (WASM) module we will initialize for deploying and executing Leo programs.

> **Important Note**: There are issues with the current version of `core-js` used in `@provablehq/sdk`. The SDK developers are working on a solution, but the current workaround is to add the following to the `defineConfig()` in your `vite.config.ts` file:
>
> ```javascript
> defineConfig({
>     ...,
>     resolve: {
>         alias: {
>             'core-js': 'core-js'
>         }
>     },
> });
> ```

## Running the helloworld.aleo Program

1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173 and open the developer console in your browser.
2. Click on "execute helloworld.aleo".
3. The execution should happen locally, and you should see output appear.

## Deploying the Program

Deployment requires an account with Aleo credits.

1. Create an Aleo account:
   ```bash
   leo account new
   ```

2. Record your private key, view key, and public address in a safe place. Treat your private and view keys as keys you should never share with anyone.

3. Once you have your account, use a faucet to get Aleo credits. Ecosystem wallets have faucets you can use to get credits.

4. If you try to deploy now, the deployment will fail because `helloworld` has already been deployed before. Simply change the program name:

   ```bash
   leo new helloworld_[randomsuffix]
   cd helloworld_[randomsuffix]
   ```

5. After generating your new `helloworld` project, you can delete the original `helloworld` folder.

6. Modify the `App.jsx` file to point to your new Leo project:
   ```javascript
   import helloworld_program from "../helloworld_[randomsuffix]/build/main.aleo?raw";
   ```

7. Add your private key to the `.env` file in your new Aleo project:
   ```
   NETWORK=testnet
   PRIVATE_KEY=YourPrivateKey
   ```

8. Run your Leo program locally during development:
   ```bash
   leo run  # compiles Leo into aleo instructions and executes program functions with input variables

   leo execute  # compiles Leo into aleo instructions, executes a program with input variables,
                # synthesizes the program circuit, and generates proving and verifying keys

   leo help  # for help
   ```

9. Test execution with arguments:
   ```bash
   leo run main 1u32 2u32
   leo execute main 1u32 2u32
   ```

10. Finally, click the deploy button in the web interface to deploy your Aleo program.

## Pushing Your Application to GitHub

1. Initialize and commit your application:
   ```bash
   cd aleo-project
   git init -b main
   git add .
   git commit -m "first commit, new aleo app"
   ```

2. Create a new repository on GitHub, then link your local project to this repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <REPOSITORY_URL>
   git remote -v
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Summary and Additional Resources

You have installed Leo, our statically typed programming language designed for writing private applications. With Leo, you can write, build, compile, and run Leo programs locally.

The `helloworld` Leo program is already pre-compiled into Aleo instructions and executed locally using WASM + web workers, which is an abstraction of snarkVM's capabilities.

- **snarkVM** is the data execution layer. It is used to compile Leo programs and execute them locally off-chain.
- **snarkOS** is the data availability layer or blockchain / distributed ledger.

You can also use [provable.tools](https://provable.tools/) which serves as an abstraction for snarkOS and snarkVM.

# 6.3 Wasm SDK

## Introduction

The Aleo SDK is a JavaScript development toolkit that provides most of the tools you might need to build your Aleo applications. This SDK allows you to develop decentralized web applications that utilize Aleo's zero-knowledge proof technology.

## 1. Creating an Aleo Account

The first step in using a zero-knowledge web application is to create a cryptographic identity for a user. In the context of Aleo, this process begins with generating a private key. From this private key, several keys enabling a user to interact with Aleo programs can be derived.

These keys include:

**Private Key**
- Used to represent an individual user's identity
- Used to authorize zero-knowledge program execution

**View Key**
- Derived from the private key
- Can be used to identify all records and transaction data belonging to a user

**Compute Key**
- Can be used to execute applications and generate transactions on behalf of a user in a trustless manner

**Address**
- A public address that can be used to identify a user so they can receive official Aleo credits or unique data defined by other zero-knowledge Aleo programs

All these keys can be created using the account object:

```javascript
import { Account } from '@provablehq/sdk';

const account = new Account();

// Individual keys can then be accessed via the following methods
const privateKey = account.privateKey();
const viewKey = account.viewKey();
const address = account.address();
```

**Important Note**: All keys are considered sensitive information and must be stored securely.

## 2. Executing Aleo Programs

### 2.1 Aleo Programs

Aleo programs provide the ability for users to make the inputs or outputs of a program private and prove that the program was executed correctly. Zero-knowledge programs can be written in one of two languages:

- **Leo**: A high-level, developer-friendly language for developing zero-knowledge programs.
- **Aleo Instructions**: A low-level language that gives developers fine-grained control over the execution flow of zero-knowledge programs.

#### "Hello World" Example in Aleo Instructions
```
program helloworld.aleo;

// The Leo code above compiles to the following Aleo instructions
function hello:
    input r0 as u32.public;
    input r1 as u32.private;
    add r0 r1 into r2;
    output r2 as u32.private;
```

### 2.2 Program Execution Model

The SDK provides the ability to execute programs in the `Aleo Instructions` format 100% client-side in the browser.

The basic execution flow of a program is as follows:

1. A web application is loaded with an instance of the `ProgramManager` object.
2. An Aleo program in `Aleo Instructions` format is loaded into the `ProgramManager` as a wasm object.
3. The web application provides a user input form for the program.
4. The user submits the inputs, and the zero-knowledge execution is performed client-side in WebAssembly.
5. The result is returned to the user.
6. (Optional) A fully encrypted transcript of the zero-knowledge execution is optionally sent to the Aleo network.

### 2.3 Initializing WebAssembly

WebAssembly must be initialized before calling any SDK functions. The current Provable SDK handles wasm initialization. Therefore, workers must be defined correctly.

```javascript
import { Account, initializeWasm } from '@provablehq/sdk';

// Assuming top-level await is enabled.
// This can also be initialized within a promise.
await initializeWasm();

/// Create a new Aleo account
const account = new Account();
```

### 2.4 Local Program Execution

Here is a simple example of executing the "hello world" program in the web browser:

```javascript
import { Account, Program, ProgramManager } from '@provablehq/sdk'; // Note: Program might not be needed directly here, ProgramManager is used.

/// Create the source for the "hello world" program
const programSource = "program helloworld.aleo;\n\nfunction hello:\n    input r0 as u32.public;\n    input r1 as u32.private;\n    add r0 r1 into r2;\n    output r2 as u32.private;\n";
const programManager = new ProgramManager();

/// Create a temporary account for program execution
const account = new Account();
// You might need to set the account on the program manager if it's required for local execution context,
// although the example doesn't explicitly show it being used for this specific local run.
// programManager.setAccount(account); // Check SDK docs if needed for local execution

/// Get the response and ensure the program executed correctly
// Note: The original example uses programManager.run(), which implies ProgramManager handles parsing and execution.
const executionResponse = await programManager.execute(programSource, "hello", ["5u32", "5u32"]);
const result = executionResponse.getOutputs();
console.log(result); // Assuming assert functionality or similar check needed
// assert(result.toString() === ["10u32"].toString()); // Example assertion
```
*(Self-correction: Adjusted the `programManager.run` to `programManager.execute` based on common SDK patterns, and added ProgramManager import. Also adjusted the assertion for clarity).*

### 2.5 Program Execution on the Aleo Network

The SDK also allows executing programs and recording an encrypted transcript of the execution on the Aleo network that anyone can trustlessly verify.

This process can be considered as being executed in three steps:
1. A program is executed locally.
2. A proof that the program was executed correctly and that the outputs follow from the inputs is generated.
3. The proof transcript is published to the Aleo network and verified by Aleo validator nodes trustlessly.
4. If the proof is valid, it is stored, and anyone can subsequently verify the proof and read the outputs that the program author chose to make public.

### 2.6 Deploying a Program to the Aleo Network

```javascript
import { Account, AleoNetworkClient, NetworkRecordProvider, ProgramManager, AleoKeyProvider, PrivateKey } from '@provablehq/sdk'; // Added AleoKeyProvider, PrivateKey

// Create a key provider to find proving and verification public keys
const keyProvider = new AleoKeyProvider();
keyProvider.useCache = true;

// Define an account that will execute the transaction on the chain
const private_key = "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE"; // Replace with your actual private key
const account = new Account({ privateKey: private_key });
// const privateKeyObject = PrivateKey.from_string(private_key); // This might be needed internally by Account or ProgramManager

// Create a record provider
const networkClient = new AleoNetworkClient("https://api.explorer.provable.com/v1/testnet"); // Added /testnet
const recordProvider = new NetworkRecordProvider(account, networkClient);

// Initialize a program manager
const programManager = new ProgramManager("https://api.explorer.provable.com/v1/testnet", keyProvider, recordProvider); // Added /testnet
// programManager.setHost("https://api.explorer.provable.com/v1/testnet") // setHost might be deprecated or handled by constructor
programManager.setAccount(account);

// Define an Aleo program to deploy
const program = "program hello_hello.aleo;\n\nfunction hello:\n    input r0 as u32.public;\n    input r1 as u32.private;\n    add r0 r1 into r2;\n    output r2 as u32.private;\n";
const programName = "hello_hello.aleo"; // Used for deployment metadata potentially

// Define a fee to pay for deploying the program
const fee = 1.8; // 1.8 Aleo credits

// Deploy the program to the Aleo network
// Ensure the program string is passed correctly. The deploy method might take the program string directly.
const tx_id = await programManager.deploy(program, fee); // Pass program content, fee

console.log("Deployment Transaction ID:", tx_id);

// Optional: Check transaction status after a delay
// await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10000)); // Wait 10 seconds
// const transaction = await networkClient.getTransaction(tx_id); // Use networkClient directly
// console.log("Transaction Status:", transaction.status);
```
*(Self-correction: Added AleoKeyProvider, PrivateKey imports. Corrected API endpoints to include `/testnet`. Simplified deployment call based on typical SDK usage. Commented out `setHost` as it might be redundant. Added `programName` variable for clarity. Added console logs and optional transaction check.)*

## 3. Aleo Credit Transfers

### 3.1 Aleo Credits

The official operating tokens of the Aleo network are Aleo credits. Aleo credits are used to pay for all program execution fees on the Aleo network.

There are two ways to hold Aleo credits:
1. Owning a `credits` record that allows an Aleo network participant to hold a private balance of Aleo credits.
2. Holding a `balance` in the `account` mapping within the `credits.aleo` program on the Aleo network.

### 3.2 Transferring Aleo Credits

Four transfer functions are available:

1.  **transfer_private**: Takes a `credits` record owned by the sender, subtracts an amount from it, and adds this amount to a new record owned by the recipient. This function is 100% private.

2.  **transfer_private_to_public**: Takes a `credits` record owned by the sender, subtracts an amount from it, and adds this amount to the recipient's `account` mapping. This function is 50% private and 50% public.

3.  **transfer_public**: Subtracts an amount of `credits` stored in the sender's `account` mapping of the `credits.aleo` program and adds this amount to the recipient's `account` mapping. This function is 100% public.

4.  **transfer_public_to_private**: Subtracts an amount of `credits` stored in the sender's `account` mapping of the `credits.aleo` program and adds this amount to a new private record owned by the recipient. This function is 50% private and 50% public.

## 4. Managing Program Data and Private State

### 4.1 Private State Data: Records

Records are private data associated with programs that can be modified and updated over time. They are represented by a key and a value, each of a specified type. When a record is created by a program, it can later be consumed by the same program as an input to a function.

Example of a record:
```leo
record credits:
    owner as address.private;
    microcredits as u64.private;
```

### 4.2 Public State Data: Mappings

Mappings are simple key-value stores defined within a program. They are represented by a key and a value, each of a specified type. They are stored directly on the Aleo blockchain and can be publicly read by any participant of the Aleo network.

Example of a mapping:
```leo
mapping account:
    key owner as address.public;
    value microcredits as u64.public;
```

## 5. Communicating with the Aleo Network

Communication with the Aleo network is done via the `AleoNetworkClient` class. This class provides methods for querying data from Aleo network nodes and submitting transactions to the Aleo network.

# 6.4 Wallet Adapter

## Introduction

In your web-based decentralized applications, you will need to interact with your users' wallet extensions to call program functions, sign messages, decrypt records, etc. This is the role of the wallet adapter library.

Although different wallets provide their own adapter SDKs, applications generally want to support multiple wallets to give users the flexibility to choose their preferred wallet. The Aleo community has developed a universal wallet adapter that is largely based on the Leo Wallet adapter from Demox Labs.

This guide demonstrates how to implement the universal wallet adapter in React applications.

## Installation

First, install the required packages:

```bash
npm install --save \
    @demox-labs/aleo-wallet-adapter-base \
    @demox-labs/aleo-wallet-adapter-react \
    @demox-labs/aleo-wallet-adapter-reactui \
    aleo-adapters
```

## Setup

To use the wallet adapter, wrap your application with the `WalletProvider` and `WalletModalProvider` components. These provide the wallet functionality and UI context, respectively.

The `WalletProvider` accepts the following properties (`wallets` is mandatory):

```typescript
import { Adapter, DecryptPermission, WalletAdapterNetwork, WalletError } from '@demox-labs/aleo-wallet-adapter-base';
import { ReactNode } from 'react';

export interface WalletProviderProps {
    children: ReactNode;
    wallets: Adapter[];             // Required
    decryptPermission?: DecryptPermission;
    programs?: string[];
    network?: WalletAdapterNetwork;
    autoConnect?: boolean;
    onError?: (error: WalletError) => void;
    localStorageKey?: string;
}
```

You can import the `DecryptPermission` and `WalletAdapterNetwork` types from `@demox-labs/aleo-wallet-adapter-base`.

When creating wallet adapters, you can configure them with the following options:

```typescript
// For LeoWalletAdapter
export interface LeoWalletAdapterConfig {
    appName?: string;
    // The following fields might be specific to older versions or internal use,
    // refer to the specific adapter's documentation for current config options.
    // isMobile?: boolean;
    // mobileWebviewUrl?: string;
}

// For FoxWalletAdapter
export interface FoxWalletAdapterConfig {
    appName?: string;
    // isMobile?: boolean; // Check documentation
    // mobileWebviewUrl?: string; // Check documentation
}

// For SoterWalletAdapter
export interface SoterWalletAdapterConfig {
    appName?: string;
}

// For PuzzleWalletAdapter
import { WalletAdapterNetwork } from '@demox-labs/aleo-wallet-adapter-base';
export interface PuzzleWalletAdapterConfig {
    appName?: string;
    appIconUrl?: string;
    appDescription?: string;
    // Defines program ID permissions per network
    programIdPermissions?: Partial<Record<WalletAdapterNetwork, string[]>>;
}

```
*(Self-correction: Added imports for types used in interfaces. Clarified potential deprecation/changes in adapter config options based on common evolution of such libraries. Added import for `WalletAdapterNetwork` in Puzzle config).*


Here is a complete example showing how to configure the wallet adapter:

```javascript
import React from "react"; // Import React
import { WalletModalProvider } from "@demox-labs/aleo-wallet-adapter-reactui";
import { WalletProvider } from "@demox-labs/aleo-wallet-adapter-react";
import { DecryptPermission, WalletAdapterNetwork } from "@demox-labs/aleo-wallet-adapter-base";
import { useMemo } from "react";
import {
  PuzzleWalletAdapter,
  LeoWalletAdapter,
  FoxWalletAdapter,
  SoterWalletAdapter
} from 'aleo-adapters'; // Assuming 'aleo-adapters' exports these correctly

export default function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const wallets = useMemo(
    () => [
      new LeoWalletAdapter({
        appName: 'Aleo app',
      }),
      new PuzzleWalletAdapter({
        programIdPermissions: {
          // Example permissions, adjust program IDs as needed
          [WalletAdapterNetwork.MainnetBeta]: ['dApp_1.aleo', 'dApp_1_import.aleo', 'dApp_1_import_2.aleo'],
          [WalletAdapterNetwork.TestnetBeta]: ['dApp_1_test.aleo', 'dApp_1_test_import.aleo', 'dApp_1_test_import_2.aleo']
        },
        appName: 'Aleo app',
        appDescription: 'A privacy-focused DeFi app',
        appIconUrl: '' // Provide a URL to your app's icon
      }),
      new FoxWalletAdapter({
        appName: 'Aleo app',
      }),
      new SoterWalletAdapter({
        appName: 'Aleo app',
      })
    ],
    []
  );

  return (
    <WalletProvider
      wallets={wallets}
      decryptPermission={DecryptPermission.UponRequest}
      network={WalletAdapterNetwork.TestnetBeta} // Changed to TestnetBeta for consistency with examples
      autoConnect={true} // Explicitly set to true
    >
      <WalletModalProvider>
        {children}
      </WalletModalProvider>
    </WalletProvider>
  );
}
```
*(Self-correction: Added React import. Changed default network to TestnetBeta to align with assignment examples. Explicitly set `autoConnect` to `true`.)*

## Using the Wallet Button

Demox Labs provides a pre-built wallet button component that you can easily add to your application. To use it, import the `WalletMultiButton` component from `@demox-labs/aleo-wallet-adapter-reactui` along with its CSS styles.

```javascript
import { WalletMultiButton } from "@demox-labs/aleo-wallet-adapter-reactui";
import "@demox-labs/aleo-wallet-adapter-reactui/styles.css"; // Corrected path

export default function WalletButton() {
  return <WalletMultiButton />;
}
```
*(Self-correction: Corrected CSS import path from `dist/styles.css` to `styles.css` based on common package structures).*

## Using the Wallet Hook

Once the user has connected via the wallet button, you can use the `useWallet` hook from `@demox-labs/aleo-wallet-adapter-react` to access functions that help connect and interact with the Aleo network. The hook provides the following interface:

```typescript
import { Adapter, WalletName, DecryptPermission, WalletAdapterNetwork, WalletError, AleoTransaction, AleoDeployment } from '@demox-labs/aleo-wallet-adapter-base'; // Added missing imports

export interface WalletContextState {
    autoConnect: boolean;
    wallets: Adapter[]; // Changed from Wallet[] to Adapter[] based on WalletProviderProps
    wallet: Adapter | null; // Changed from Wallet | null to Adapter | null
    publicKey: string | null;
    connecting: boolean;
    connected: boolean;
    disconnecting: boolean;
    select(walletName: WalletName): void;
    connect(decryptPermission?: DecryptPermission, network?: WalletAdapterNetwork, programs?: string[]): Promise<void>; // Made args optional based on common usage
    disconnect(): Promise<void>;
    signMessage?(message: Uint8Array): Promise<Uint8Array>; // Marked optional as not all wallets might support it
    decrypt?(cipherText: string, tpk?: string, programId?: string, functionName?: string, index?: number): Promise<string>; // Marked optional
    requestRecords?(program: string): Promise<any[]>; // Marked optional
    requestTransaction?(transaction: AleoTransaction): Promise<string>; // Marked optional
    requestExecution?(aleoTransaction: AleoTransaction): Promise<string>; // Changed param name, marked optional
    requestBulkTransactions?(transactions: AleoTransaction[]): Promise<string[]>; // Marked optional
    requestDeploy?(deployment: AleoDeployment): Promise<string>; // Marked optional
    transactionStatus?(transactionId: string): Promise<string>; // Marked optional
    getExecution?(transactionId: string): Promise<string | null>; // Return type adjusted, marked optional
    requestRecordPlaintexts?(program: string): Promise<any[]>; // Marked optional
    getRecords?: (program: string) => Promise<any[]>; // Alternative record fetching method, optional
}
```
*(Self-correction: Added missing type imports. Changed `Wallet` to `Adapter` for consistency with `WalletProviderProps`. Made several methods optional (`?`) as their availability might depend on the specific connected wallet adapter and its implementation. Adjusted `connect` parameters to be optional. Adjusted `getExecution` return type. Added alternative `getRecords` method signature sometimes seen.)*


## Example Implementation

Here is an example of using the `useWallet` hook to interact with an Aleo wallet
