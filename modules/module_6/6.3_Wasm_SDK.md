# 6.3 Wasm SDK

## Introduction

The Aleo SDK is a JavaScript development toolkit that provides most of the tools you might need to build your Aleo applications. This SDK allows you to develop decentralized web applications that utilize Aleo's zero-knowledge proof technology.

## 1. Creating an Aleo Account

The first step in using a zero-knowledge web application is to create a cryptographic identity for a user. In the context of Aleo, this process begins with generating a private key. From this private key, several keys enabling a user to interact with Aleo programs can be derived.

These keys include:

**Private Key**
- Used to represent an individual user's identity
- Used to authorize zero-knowledge program execution

**View Key**
- Used to decrypt private records
- Used to view private transactions

**Address**
- Used to receive funds and interact with programs

**Proving Key**
- Used to generate zero-knowledge proofs

**Verifying Key**
- Used to verify zero-knowledge proofs

## 2. Running Programs and Transactions

The SDK allows you to compile, execute, and interact with Leo programs, as well as to generate and verify zero-knowledge proofs. You can also submit transactions to the Aleo network.

## 3. Aleo Credit Transfers

### 3.1 Aleo Credits

The official operating tokens of the Aleo network are Aleo credits. Aleo credits are used to pay for all program execution fees on the Aleo network.

There are two ways to hold Aleo credits:
1. Owning a `credits` record that allows an Aleo network participant to hold a private balance of Aleo credits.
2. Holding a `balance` in the `account` mapping within the `credits.aleo` program on the Aleo network.

### 3.2 Transferring Aleo Credits

Four transfer functions are available:

1.  **transfer_private**: Takes a `credits` record owned by the sender, subtracts an amount from it, and adds this amount to a new record owned by the recipient. This function is 100% private.

2.  **transfer_private_to_public**: Takes a `credits` record owned by the sender, subtracts an amount from it, and adds this amount to the recipient's `account` mapping. This function is 50% private and 50% public.

3.  **transfer_public**: Subtracts an amount of `credits` stored in the sender's `account` mapping of the `credits.aleo` program and adds this amount to the recipient's `account` mapping. This function is 100% public.

4.  **transfer_public_to_private**: Subtracts an amount of `credits` stored in the sender's `account` mapping of the `credits.aleo` program and adds this amount to a new private record owned by the recipient. This function is 50% private and 50% public.

## 4. Managing Program Data and Private State

### 4.1 Private State Data: Records

Records are private data associated with programs that can be modified and updated over time. They are represented by a key and a value, each of a specified type. When a record is created by a program, it can later be consumed by the same program as an input to a function.

Example of a record:
```leo
record credits:
    owner as address.private;
    microcredits as u64.private;
```

### 4.2 Public State Data: Mappings

Mappings are simple key-value stores defined within a program. They are represented by a key and a value, each of a specified type. They are stored directly on the Aleo blockchain and can be publicly read by any participant of the Aleo network.

Example of a mapping:
```leo
mapping account:
    key owner as address.public;
    value microcredits as u64.public;
```

## 5. Communicating with the Aleo Network

Communication with the Aleo network is done via the `AleoNetworkClient` class. This class provides methods for querying data from Aleo network nodes and submitting transactions to the Aleo network.
