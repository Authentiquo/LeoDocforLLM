# 6.4 Wallet Adapter

## Introduction

In your web-based decentralized applications, you will need to interact with your users' wallet extensions to call program functions, sign messages, decrypt records, etc. This is the role of the wallet adapter library.

Although different wallets provide their own adapter SDKs, applications generally want to support multiple wallets to give users the flexibility to choose their preferred wallet. The Aleo community has developed a universal wallet adapter that is largely based on the Leo Wallet adapter from Demox Labs.

This guide demonstrates how to implement the universal wallet adapter in React applications.

## Installation

First, install the required packages:

```bash
npm install --save \
    @demox-labs/aleo-wallet-adapter-base \
    @demox-labs/aleo-wallet-adapter-react \
    @demox-labs/aleo-wallet-adapter-reactui \
    aleo-adapters
```

## Setup

To use the wallet adapter, wrap your application with the `WalletProvider` and `WalletModalProvider` components. These provide the wallet functionality and UI context, respectively.
