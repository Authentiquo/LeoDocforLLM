# 6.1 RPC API

## Introduction

When you run the snarkOS software, all nodes (provers, validators, and simple clients) automatically have a local RPC API. This API exposes blockchain data so that it is accessible via simple HTTP calls.

Here is an example of an RPC API URL, exposed on the internet by the Provable team:
```
https://api.explorer.provable.com/v1/{network}
```

On your own machine, for example when running a devnet client, you should be able to access it at the following address:
```
http://127.0.0.1:3030/{network}
```

## Useful Endpoints

Let's explore some of the endpoints that might be useful for your DApps.

You can also find the full documentation for other endpoints here:

There are other custom APIs created by the community that can be very useful for your programs:
- [Haruka's API](https://api.explorer.provable.com/v1/{network}) (Note: This seems to be the same URL as the Provable one provided earlier, likely an example of a community-utilized endpoint)
- Leo Wallet RPC

The following endpoint to reach the latest block height can be used to test if the API is operational:
```
https://api.explorer.provable.com/v1/testnet/block/height/latest
```
