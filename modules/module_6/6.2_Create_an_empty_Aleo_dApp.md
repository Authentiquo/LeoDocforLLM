# 6.2 Create an Empty Aleo dApp

## Introduction

In this section, we will learn how to create an empty Aleo web application using NPM.

## Creating the Project

To create your first empty Aleo web application using NPM:

```bash
npm create leo-app@latest
```

1. Enter the project name.

2. Choose a framework from the following options:
   - `React`
   - `Node.js`
   - `Vanilla (JavaScript)`

3. If you choose `React` as the framework, the supported templates are:
   - `JavaScript` + `Leo`
   - `TypeScript` + `Leo`
   - `TypeScript` + `Next.js`

## Project Setup

Navigate to the project you just installed:

```bash
cd aleo-project
npm install
npm run install-leo
npm run dev
```

This installs all required modules as well as Leo, our statically typed programming language designed for writing private applications. Finally, we initialized a local instance of your React application at http://localhost:5173.

Project Structure:
- `src/App.jsx` contains the main body of your React application.
- The `helloworld` folder is your Leo program.
- `src/workers/worker.js` is the WebAssembly (WASM) module we will initialize for deploying and executing Leo programs.

> **Important Note**: There are issues with the current version of `core-js` used in `@provablehq/sdk`. The SDK developers are working on a solution, but the current workaround is to add the following to the `defineConfig()` in your `vite.config.ts` file:
>
> ```javascript
> defineConfig({
>     ...,
>     resolve: {
>         alias: {
>             'core-js': 'core-js'
>         }
>     },
> });
> ```

## Running the helloworld.aleo Program

1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173 and open the developer console in your browser.
2. Click on "execute helloworld.aleo".
3. The execution should happen locally, and you should see output appear.

## Deploying the Program

Deployment requires an account with Aleo credits.

1. Create an Aleo account:
   ```bash
   leo account new
   ```

You have installed Leo, our statically typed programming language designed for writing private applications. With Leo, you can write, build, compile, and run Leo programs locally.

The `helloworld` Leo program is already pre-compiled into Aleo instructions and executed locally using WASM + web workers, which is an abstraction of snarkVM's capabilities.

- **snarkVM** is the data execution layer. It is used to compile Leo programs and execute them locally off-chain.
- **snarkOS** is the data availability layer or blockchain / distributed ledger.

You can also use [provable.tools](https://provable.tools/) which serves as an abstraction for snarkOS and snarkVM.
