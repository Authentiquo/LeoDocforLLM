# 5.1 Composability (Part 4): Asynchronous Transitions and Reading External Mappings

## Calling an Asynchronous Transition

Asynchronous transition calls are slightly different from the non-asynchronous calls we just learned about. The reason is that there is both on-chain and off-chain code being executed. For each of them, we can independently decide whether the calling program's code should execute before/after the imported code.

To understand this, let's first explore the syntax through an example. Our arithmetic program will now store a counter of how many times it has been called using a mapping.

```leo
program arithmetic.aleo { // Renamed for consistency
    mapping counter: u8 => u64;
    // ...
}
```

All function statements, mapping reads, writes, etc., are executed sequentially in the same order as their future is awaited.

Note that futures can be awaited in a different order than the off-chain executions. The following body for the `finalize_calls_2transitions` function above would also be valid:

```leo
async function finalize_calls_2transitions(future1: Future, future2: Future){
    future2.await();
    future1.await();
}
```

## Reading External Mappings

Although a mapping cannot be updated directly by another program, it is possible to read its value. Here is an example:

```leo
import arithmetic.aleo; // Assuming arithmetic.aleo

program quadratic.aleo {
    async transition read_external_mapping() -> Future { // Needs to be async to call finalize
        let read_future: Future = finalize_read_external_mapping();
        return read_future;
    }
    async function finalize_read_external_mapping(){ // On-chain execution
        // Reads the value from arithmetic.aleo's counter mapping at key 0u8
        let count: u64 = arithmetic.aleo/counter.get(0u8);
        assert_neq(count, 0u64); // Example assertion
    }
}
```

You can also use the mapping functions `contains` and `get_or_use` in this way.
