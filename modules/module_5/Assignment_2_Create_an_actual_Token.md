# Exercise 2: Create an "actual" Token

The goal of this exercise is to create your first Aleo token following the current community-adopted token standard: ARC21 (using the `token_registry.aleo` program).

Following the specifications from chapter 5.4, your objective is to write a program managing such a token: handling the registration and initial coin offering (minting) of the token. It must import the `token_registry.aleo` program:

```leo
import token_registry.aleo; // Ensure this program is available in imports
```

## Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Understand how to use the community token standard (ARC21 via the registry).
- Write your first DeFi-related program interacting with the registry.

## Tasks

Your program (`my_arc21_token.aleo` or similar name) should include the following transitions:
