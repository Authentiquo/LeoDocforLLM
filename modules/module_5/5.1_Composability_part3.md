# 5.1 Composability (Part 3): External Records and Imported Structs

## External Records

Let's update our imported program to include a counter record, to count the number of times it has been called from `quadratic.aleo`:

```leo
program arithmetic.aleo { // Renamed for consistency, assuming it was arithmetic.aleo
    record Counter {
        owner: address,
        amount: u64
    }

    transition create() -> Counter {
        let counter: Counter = Counter {
            owner: self.signer,
            amount: 0u64
        };
        return counter;
    }

    // The square function now includes a Counter type input/output.
    transition square_u64(a: u64, in_counter: Counter) -> (u64, Counter) {
        let out_counter: Counter = Counter {
            owner: in_counter.owner,
            amount: in_counter.amount + 1u64
        };
        return (a*a, out_counter);
    }
}
```

Here's how `quadratic.aleo` can now provide these external records:

```leo
import arithmetic.aleo; // Assuming arithmetic.aleo

program quadratic.aleo {
    transition residue(
        a: u64, n: u64, in_counter: arithmetic.aleo/Counter // Corrected import path
    ) -> (u64, arithmetic.aleo/Counter) { // Corrected import path
        let (squared, out_counter): (
            u64, arithmetic.aleo/Counter // Corrected import path
        ) = arithmetic.aleo/square_u64(a, in_counter); // Pass the record directly
        let out_residue: u64 = squared.mod(n);
        return (out_residue, out_counter);
    }
}
```

Note that before each record name, the ID of the imported program is provided before the slash.

Having an external record as an output of a program does not necessarily mean it will consume that record. The record will only be consumed if it is used as input to a transition of the original program in which it was defined.

## Imported Structs

When you import a program that defines `struct` data types, make sure to redefine these structs in the importing program as it might lead to errors. Unlike records, you do not add the program ID before the imported struct name.

Here is an example program defining and using a struct:

```leo
program arithmetic.aleo { // Renamed for consistency
    struct Point {
        x: u64,
        y: u64
    }

    transition add_points(a: Point, b: Point) -> Point {
        let c: Point = Point {
            x: a.x + b.x,
            y: a.y + b.y
        };
        return c;
    }
}
```

And here is how the importing program can use these structs:

```leo
import arithmetic.aleo; // Assuming arithmetic.aleo

program quadratic.aleo {
    // Redefine the struct with the same name and fields
    struct Point {
        x: u64,
        y: u64
    }

    // Use the struct like a normal struct
    transition double_point(a: Point) -> Point {
        // Use the imported program's function for the operation
        let doubled: Point = arithmetic.aleo/add_points(a, a);
        return doubled;
    }
}
```
