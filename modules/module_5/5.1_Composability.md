# 5.1 Composability

On blockchains, isolated programs are generally not the norm. In fact, what's interesting about developing on a blockchain is that, in theory, anyone can build their own applications by leveraging the tokens, states, and functionalities of other applications. Things become more interesting when multiple programs work together. This is generally referred to as program composability.

## Importing a Program

On Aleo, a transition from one program can call a transition from another program. Here's how it works in practice.

Let's take a first example program, `arithmetic.aleo`, with a transition that calculates the square value of an input.

```
leo new arithmetic
cd arithmetic
```

Let's update `arithmetic/src/main.leo` with the following code:

```leo
program arithmetic.aleo {
    transition square_u64(a: u64) -> u64 {
        return a*a;
    }
}
```

Now let's create another program, quadratic residue, which calculates the quadratic residue of a number modulo another, using our first transition.

```
cd ..
leo new quadratic
cd quadratic
```

We first need to add the other program to our list of external dependencies:

```
leo add arithmetic --local ../arithmetic
```

The `local` argument here is the path to the local Leo folder of the project. If you want to use a program already deployed on-chain, use instead:

```
leo add your_program_id.aleo --network testnet # Or mainnet depending on the network
```
